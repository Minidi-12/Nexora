# Nexora Campus Copilot

## Project Overview
After NovaCore University's prior Campus Copilot system was corrupted, an AI-driven digital assistant called **Nexora Campus Copilot** was created to restore functionality and confidence.  The project presents a robust, secure, and multilingual chatbot interface that is intended to effectively and consistently provide students with important university information.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to:
- Restore and improve NovaCore University's digital support system.
- Enhance academic achievement and student well-being by providing trustworthy, easily available information services.
- Establish a new benchmark for the resilience of instructional technology to online disturbances.
